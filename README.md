# Repository Information

This repository is for the final ML (Machine Learning) project for "CRSS 8030 - Data Science and Statistical Programming Applied to Agriculture"" class of Dr. Leo Bastos.

# Goal of the project

We have been provided with a **corn variety trial** data set.  
This data contains over **164,000 rows** spanning **10 years** (2014-2023), **45 sites** across the USA, for a total of **270** site-years, where over **5,000** corn hybrids were evaluated.  

We have been provided with the following **training data** for years 2014-2023:   

  - Trait information (including site, year, hybrid, yield, and grain moisture) [the yield that we see in this "trait information" is for whatever moisture it is being reported right next to it. We will need to transform this to 15.5% moisture, which is the default that we report the corn grain yield] 
  - Meta information (including site, year, previous crop, planting date, harvest date, longitude, and latitude)  
  - Soil information (including site, year, soil pH, soil organic matter, soil P, soil K)  

We are also being provided with the following **testing data** for year 2024:  
  - Submission information (site, year, hybrid, **no yield**)  
  - Meta information (same as training)  
  - Soil information (same as training)  

> We are tasked in training machine learning models using the training data to predict yield on the test data.  

One difference from class is that **we are not provided with the test data yield (predicted variable)**, only the predictor variables.  
Therefore, using the training data wisely to create predictive models will be important.
